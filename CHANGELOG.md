# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Sand-filter pump "Quick Run" button + duration number. The pump's plain
  on/off switch has no duration parameter and always falls back to the
  device's own fixed default run time; Quick Run writes a genuine one-time
  schedule entry (today's date, `days=0`) instead, so pressing it runs the
  pump for exactly the configured number of hours (up to 72) and then stops
  — no recurring program left behind. Uses the pump's own one-shot encoding
  (`on=1` + a specific date), distinct from the saltwater chlorinator's
  `on=0`/Boost encoding, which is chlorinator-hardware-specific and doesn't
  apply to the pump. Slot 0 is reserved for Quick Run and excluded from the
  generic per-slot "Schedule 1" switch/duration/start-time entities (matching
  how the saltwater system already hides its Boost slot), so a program you
  set up on a different slot is never at risk. **Upgrade note:** if you had
  already programmed the pump's first schedule slot directly in the Tuya app
  before installing this version, pressing Quick Run once will overwrite that
  program — check the Tuya app's schedule for that slot before first use.

## [0.21.2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Manual local setup's protocol `auto` mode now tries every supported candidate
  (3.4, 3.5, 3.3, and 3.1) before treating TinyTuya Err 914 as rejected
  credentials. This fixes valid SX2100 setups that work on 3.5 but were rejected
  when the previous setup check tried only 3.4. The proven version is persisted
  for runtime startup, and auto uses one quick attempt per candidate instead of
  multiplying the socket timeout by each candidate's retry budget.
- Tuya cloud setup now exposes Western Europe, Eastern America, and Singapore in
  addition to the existing regions, matching TinyTuya 1.20's distinct endpoints.
- Schedule field edits are now atomic read-modify-write operations. Concurrent
  slot, duration, time, Boost, or service edits can no longer derive two full
  blobs from the same stale state and silently discard the first change. Known
  pre-write cloud shadows are ignored until Tuya reflects the write or returns
  a genuinely different external update.

### Documentation
- Added the Tuya Smart/Smart Life account-linking, IoT Core, exact data-center,
  authorization propagation, LAN-IP, and local-key rotation troubleshooting
  reported across issues #13 and #18.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-08-04

### Documentation
- Clarify the verified control split used by the pool safety controller:
  SX2100 DP104 is master power and DP106 is filtration start/stop; salt DP104
  is master power and DP103 is chlorine-production start/stop. Operational
  stop must not be inferred solely from a master-power switch.
- Record the 2026-07-14 physical SX2100 verification: toggling the DP106
  filtration switch OFF→ON recovered the motor from `sleep`/E93 and raised
  measured load from about 1.2 W to 207 W. Local entity read-back was briefly
  unavailable during the restart and then recovered.

### Fixed
- Serialize requests made through the shared TinyTuya cloud client. The water
  sensor and its schedule coordinators previously polled in parallel, which
  could corrupt TinyTuya's stateful request/signature handling and leave the
  WA510 values stale with an `unexpected response (NoneType)` error.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Pump schedules are now auto-detected and displayed separately from saltwater
  schedules in the bundled dashboard card.
- Home Assistant 2026.6+ can suggest the Intex Pool card when an Intex entity is
  selected in the card picker.
- Added a release-consistency verifier for manifest, Python, npm, lockfile and
  generated-card versions, plus Node tests for card entity detection.
- Added an evidence-level compatibility matrix for verified and inferred device
  behaviour.

### Changed
- Updated TinyTuya to 1.20.0, esbuild to 0.28.1, supported GitHub Actions majors,
  and the card build job to Node.js 24.
- Push CI now runs for branches rather than release tags, avoiding duplicate
  main-and-tag workflow runs.

### Fixed
- Optional standalone Tuya schedule clients now retry through coordinator polls.
  A startup cloud outage leaves schedule entities unavailable temporarily while
  local pump/salt controls stay loaded; schedules recover without an entry reload.
- Stored-credential reconfigure failures now show `cannot_connect` or `no_devices`
  instead of returning a blank credential form.
- Clearing a linked pump's optional power or energy sensor now removes it instead
  of the schema silently restoring the old default.
- esbuild 0.28 output lowers template literals so generated Lit whitespace remains
  escaped and the committed bundle passes `git diff --check`.
- Declared the integration as config-entry-only so hassfest no longer emits a
  `CONFIG_SCHEMA` quality annotation for the card-registration `async_setup` hook.

### Security
- Removed the moderate development-server vulnerability in esbuild 0.24.2; npm
  audit reports no known vulnerabilities for the card build dependencies.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **SX2100 pump control** now defaults to the verified master-power DP104 instead
  of the generic Tuya DP1. Existing DP1 entries auto-heal only when live device
  data contains DP104 and no DP1, preserving genuinely custom DP1 devices.
- **Pump-only schedules** now keep the Tuya cloud credentials entered during
  discovery. The `skdl_filter` coordinator and its schedule entities therefore
  load without requiring a water analyzer in the same config entry.
- Pump-only cloud credentials are reused by reconfigure, can be updated through
  reauth, and the pump/analyzer schedule coordinators are included in diagnostics.
- Dashboard-card setup now documents the required browser reload and a manual
  resource fallback when Home Assistant's card picker has not loaded the module.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-02

Pump corrections from the live thing model (fetched from the cloud).

### Added
- **Filtration switch (DP106)** is now enabled by default and properly named —
  the thing model confirms it is a writable start/stop control distinct from
  master power (like the chlorinator's power/production pair).
- **Pump-specific alarm codes**: the pump's DP127 enum differs from the
  chlorinator's (normal / E93 / **dirty** / unnormal) — "dirty" = clean the
  filter. The alarm sensor now uses the correct option set with translations.

### Fixed
- **The pump has no Boost cycle**: slot 1 is a regular timed slot (the pump
  app writes one-shot runs into any slot), so it now gets a normal name, a
  start-time editor, and no boost-suspend behavior. Boost stays
  chlorinator-only.
- **Stale-device deletion**: the leftover virtual "Linked pump" device from
  entity mode could never be deleted after switching to a real Tuya pump —
  the removal guard now only protects it while the pump is entity-linked.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- The sensor step rejected the new optional model field during reconfigure
  (the prefill branch fell back to the base schema). Regression-tested.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- 0.19.0 shipped the pump-schedule slot switches and durations but not the
  start-time editors (a patch-tooling miss) — the pump now gets its start
  times (slots 2-7) as intended.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-02

Full pump-timer editing + choose your device models.

### Added
- **Editable pump schedule**: the Tuya pump's internal timer program now gets
  the same editors as the chlorinator — one on/off switch per slot, start
  times (slots 2-7) and durations, all writing ``skdl_filter`` through the
  cloud. The write path was live-verified on an SX2100 (round-trip, no-op
  write, field change + readback, restore) before shipping.
- **Model selection**: the sensor/salt/pump setup and reconfigure steps offer
  an optional model picker (suggestions + free text). The chosen model is
  shown on the device page instead of the generic fallback.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-02

The Tuya sand-filter pump is now a first-class device.

### Added
- **Pump entities** (live-verified against the SX2100 via the cloud shadow
  API): status (DP125), alarm code (DP127), error code (DP114), time
  remaining (DP110), mesh/link diagnostic (DP119), and the thing-model's
  second toggle DP106 ("Filter switch", disabled by default — its standalone
  effect is unverified).
- **Pump schedule (read-only)**: the pump's internal timer program
  (``skdl_filter``, same 7-slot blob as the chlorinator's) is polled from the
  cloud and exposed as a "Schedules" sensor with full slot details, and
  included in the ``intex_pool.get_schedule`` service response (``pump`` key).
  Write support can follow once slot semantics are verified on the hardware.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-02

Robustness round: the remaining review-backlog plus regressions caught by a
fresh /code-review of the fixes themselves.

### Fixed
- **Reauth now actually triggers for permanently bad credentials**: the
  transient-tolerance counters persist across setup retries (HA rebuilds the
  coordinators on every ConfigEntryNotReady), so bad creds escalate to a
  reauth prompt instead of looping "not ready" forever. Counters are cleared
  on unload.
- **CloudClient detects rejected credentials**: tinytuya's Cloud never raises
  on bad creds (it just leaves token unset) — the client now raises an auth
  error at construction, so setup and the config flow can distinguish bad
  credentials (reauth) from a dead link (retry).
- **Version auto-detect vs. reauth ordering**: a locked-in protocol version
  re-enters auto-detection after 5 consecutive failures, and the reauth
  threshold now leaves room for a full candidate cycle after that unlock — a
  device firmware protocol change no longer escalates into a reauth prompt
  for a key that was never wrong.
- **Local poll and manual writes are serialized** per device (one TCP session
  at a time), so a switch write can no longer race the 15s poll.
- **Setup survives a dead Tuya cloud at boot**: CloudClient construction
  failures become ConfigEntryNotReady (retry with backoff) instead of an
  unhandled setup error requiring a manual reload.
- **intex_pool.set_schedule picks a writable entry** in multi-entry setups
  instead of erroring on an entry that only has the read-only analyzer
  schedule.
- **Unknown DP127 alarm codes are logged** (once per code) instead of
  silently normalizing to "unknown" — a fault combination missing from the
  enum no longer disappears without a trace.

### Added
- **Manual reconfigure preserves unticked devices** (merge) instead of
  silently dropping them, with explicit "Remove …" checkboxes for actual
  removal — the only removal path for setups without cloud credentials.
- **Reconfigure credentials prompt prefills** the stored region/Access ID
  (never the secret).

## [0.16.1] - 2026-07-02

Fixes from a full adversarially-verified code review (28 findings; the
correctness/safety ones land here).

### Fixed
- **Pump auto mode now keys on chlorine production (DP103), not master power
  (DP104)**, and keeps the pump running for 1 hour after production stops
  (after-run flush per the manual) instead of cutting it immediately. With
  master power deliberately left on 24/7, the old logic would have run the
  pump constantly.
- **Schedule edits no longer overwrite each other**: writes are serialized and
  the just-written slots are published optimistically, so a second edit inside
  the cloud's settle window no longer builds on the stale blob and silently
  undoes the first edit.
- **Pump mesh status (DP126) polarity**: the wire value is inverted
  (1 = link down); the binary sensor now reports proper connectivity
  semantics (on = connected) with the connectivity device class.
- **Self-clean cycle select** now offers the full documented range: the legal
  8 h setting was missing, and a device set to 8 h showed an empty select.
- **Card: no more false green "OK"** — when the chlorinator's entities are
  unavailable (device offline) the status pill now shows a grey "Offline"
  instead of a reassuring OK (this hid a real 4-day outage).
- **Stale card bundle**: the built frontend JS is regenerated as part of the
  release again (0.16.0 shipped a 0.15.0 bundle).

### Security
- The Tuya **local key is now masked** (password field) in the manual
  salt/pump setup, reconfigure and reauth forms, and stored secrets
  (local_key / access_secret) are **no longer embedded as suggested values**
  in reconfigure forms sent to the frontend.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-01

Reconfigure can now heal a moved device and reach devices on other VLANs.

### Added
- **Manual reconfigure escape**: both the reconfigure credentials prompt and the
  device picker now offer "Enter device details manually instead" — needed when a
  device sits on another VLAN/subnet the LAN broadcast scan cannot see (real-world
  case: the chlorinator re-joined WiFi on an SSID mapped to a different VLAN and
  got a new IP the scan could not discover). The manual chain pre-fills the
  entry's current device selections and values.

### Fixed
- **Stale IP/key after a network change**: the discover step kept the stored
  host/key whenever the device id was unchanged, so a device that moved to a new
  IP (new DHCP lease, other subnet) or rotated its local key could never be
  repaired by reconfigure. A live LAN-scan hit now takes precedence over the
  stored config; the stored config is only reused when the scan cannot see the
  device. A Tuya pump keeps its configured on-DP when refreshed this way.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-11

LSI water balance + audit test gaps closed.

### Added
- **LSI sensor** (Langelier Saturation Index): computed continuously from live (calibrated)
  pH + water temperature and your manual test inputs — new **Total alkalinity / Calcium
  hardness / Cyanuric acid / TDS (test)** number entities on the water-sensor device.
  Math verified against the published industry tables (CDC MAHC 2024 Annex 5.7.4.6,
  Taylor/CPO charts, Wojtowicz JSPSI closed forms, PHTA CYA correction): AF = log₁₀(carb.
  alk), CF = log₁₀(0.4·CH), Wojtowicz temperature polynomial, MAHC TDS constant
  (12.1/12.2), pH-dependent cyanurate correction (~CYA/3 at pH 7.6). For SWG pools the
  TDS automatically falls back to the live salinity reading when not set manually.
- **Water balance** enum sensor interpreting the LSI: severely corrosive / slightly
  corrosive / balanced (−0.3…+0.3 per CDC MAHC & Orenda) / slightly scaling (+0.3…+0.5,
  tolerated by APSP/Taylor) / scale forming.
- Tests for the previously untested paths: card/static-path + service registration in
  `async_setup`, the cloud-secret reauth branch, pump-auto restore-on-restart.

### Notes
- **Measurement-history backfill was investigated and dropped**: Tuya's device-log APIs do
  not return data-point report history on the free IoT Core tier (verified live — only
  online/offline events come back). Documented in the README troubleshooting section.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-10

Calibration against your own reference tests + user-adjustable pool volume.

### Added
- **Calibrate against a reference test** (`intex_pool.calibrate`): aligns the pH (or ORP)
  reading with your own drop-test/strip result by storing a software offset
  (offset = reference − current reading). Research-grounded guardrails: deadband below the
  device's 0.1 pH resolution, hard clamp at ±0.5 pH / ±100 mV (beyond that the probe needs
  cleaning + a buffer calibration in the Intex app — an offset would hide a real problem),
  and the corrected value is what the Action-required roll-up judges. The raw reading stays
  visible as the `raw_value` attribute. `clear_calibration` removes the offsets.
- **pH / ORP calibration offset number entities** (config category; ORP is advanced and
  disabled by default — home tests measure chlorine, not ORP, and a low ORP is usually
  chemistry or fouling).
- **Auto-reset on app recalibration**: the integration watches the device's own (read-only)
  calibration coefficients; when the Intex app recalibrates the probes, the now-obsolete
  software offsets are reset to 0 and a repair issue explains why. A repair also warns when
  software offsets are older than the manual's 4-month calibration cadence.
- **Pool volume entity** (`number`) + **Volume unit** select (litres / US gallons) right on
  the saltwater device — no need to open Configure. The salt advisor reads them live; the
  unit choice never converts the stored figure.

### Changed
- The salt advisor entity now always exists; without a pool volume it stays empty with a
  `set_pool_volume` status hint.
- FC remains uncalibrated by design: it is computed device-side from the *uncorrected*
  pH/ORP and labeled "reference only" by Intex; ground truth for chlorine is a FAS-DPD
  drop test.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-10

Advisory features grounded in the device manuals + deep online research (iopool/poolchem
patterns, TFP community practice, Tuya thing-model verification).

### Added
- **Salt dose advisor** (`Salt to add`, kg): set your pool volume under ⋮ → Configure and the
  sensor computes how much salt reaches the target salinity (default 950 ppm — the QS-series
  optimum; formula kg = L × Δppm ÷ 10⁶, matching the manual's own examples). Above 1800 ppm it
  flips to the manual's E92 dilution advice (drain/refill %). Advisory only.
- **Action required** binary sensor — one PROBLEM flag rolling up: active salt alarm, probe
  maintenance, pH outside 7.2–7.8, ORP below the 650 mV sanitation floor, salinity outside
  800–1800 ppm, stale analyzer data. The `reasons` attribute lists what triggered for
  notifications/automations.
- **Cold water** binary sensor — flags electrolysis-hostile water below 15 °C (the unit itself
  errors with E03 under 10 °C); protects the cell in shoulder season.
- **Cell wear** sensor — electrolysis-cell runtime as % of the 5000 h counter range (assumed
  rated life).
- **Analyzer measurement schedules** (read-only): the water analyzer's own `skdl_orpph` schedule
  blob is now decoded — same 7-slot format as the saltwater schedule (byte-format live-verified).
  Per the manual these windows drive hourly measurements and group-mode authority.
- **`intex_pool.get_schedule` service** with response data — returns the decoded slot tables for
  both devices. `set_schedule` now optionally returns the resulting table too.
- **Fixable stale-data repair**: the "stale sensor data" issue now has a Fix button that forces a
  fresh measurement (wakes the sleeping sensor).
- Card: **ORP trend marker** on the ORP tile (from the trend entity) and a **stale badge** with
  relative age next to the battery when the newest measurement is older than 3 h.
- Setup polish: contextual help texts (`data_description`) on all config/options fields.

### Changed
- Options now include pool volume + target salinity (advisor), alongside polling intervals.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-10

Follow-up fixes found by a re-audit of the v0.12.0 release.

### Fixed
- **Event entities: no more spurious event after restart.** When a cloud property (e.g.
  `error_code`) was absent from the first poll — the cloud only reports properties the device has
  ever emitted — its first appearance later fired a false transition event. The first observed
  value now seeds the baseline silently.
- **Card: `saltwater_abnormal` no longer masked.** The ORP indicator's fourth state now colors the
  ORP tile as a problem instead of silently falling back to the numeric range (which could show
  green while the device reported a fault).
- **Repairs survive connectivity loss.** An active alarm/maintenance/stale repair issue is no
  longer deleted just because the device went offline — only a confirmed clear removes it.
- **Repairs are purged when the integration is removed** (`async_remove_entry`), so no orphaned
  issues linger in the Repairs dashboard.
- **Pump auto mode** no longer stacks concurrent sync service calls on rapid coordinator updates.

### Changed
- `hacs.json`: added `hide_default_branch` (the `main` branch is no longer offered as a
  downloadable "version" in HACS) and dropped the legacy `render_readme` flag (dead in HACS 2.x).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-10

Hardening + feature release after a full multi-agent audit of the integration and card.

### Fixed
- **Tuya pump: configured on/off data point was ignored.** The switch looked the DP up under the
  wrong config key and always fell back to DP 1 — a custom `pump_on_dp` now actually applies.
- **Schedule writes commit state only on success.** Slot toggles / Boost no longer update their
  remembered/suspended bookkeeping (or UI state) when the cloud write fails; all schedule editors
  (toggle, duration, start time) now surface write failures as proper Home Assistant errors.
- **Rotated local key is detected in auto-version mode.** When every protocol-version candidate is
  rejected as bad auth, the coordinator now escalates to the re-authentication flow instead of
  cycling versions forever.
- **Local writes can no longer silently fail.** tinytuya doesn't raise on a rejected/undelivered
  command — the response is now checked, so an offline device surfaces as an error instead of a
  switch that looks like it worked.
- **Pump auto mode** defers its initial sync until Home Assistant has fully started (the linked
  switch's integration may not be loaded yet during boot) and logs a warning when the pump switch
  can't be reached (the service call is now blocking).
- Card: a water-sensor-only setup is no longer misclassified as a saltwater system (shared
  `water_temp` key no longer drives detection); the configured free-chlorine entity now actually
  renders as a tile; failed service calls from the card are caught and shown as a notification
  (with a busy state preventing double-taps); light-variant status colors now meet WCAG AA
  contrast; toggle pills expose `aria-pressed`.
- Config flow: a rejected key fails immediately instead of being retried through the full
  transport-retry budget.
- `manifest.json` `iot_class` corrected to `cloud_polling` (the water sensor + schedules poll the
  Tuya cloud).

### Added
- **Diagnostics** (Settings → Devices & Services → ⋮ → Download diagnostics) with local keys and
  cloud credentials redacted — raw coordinator data included for bug reports.
- **Repairs**: saltwater alarms (E90 flow, E91/E92 salt, E01–E04 electrode/temperature, E97/E99
  hardware) with the manual's fix steps, a probe-maintenance reminder, and a **stale sensor data**
  warning (newest measurement older than 3 h).
- **Last measurement** timestamp sensor — per-property report times from the cloud are now kept
  instead of thrown away.
- **Alarm / Error event entities** that fire on every transition (logbook + automation triggers).
- New entities: **ORP trend** (`ORP_dif_Number`), sensor-side **link status** (`mesh_indicator`),
  **stabilizer (CYA) flag** switch (`fc_sta_flg`), **Chlorine production 2** switch (DP 102,
  disabled by default — effect unverified on hardware), and read-only pH/ORP
  calibration-coefficient diagnostics (disabled by default; writing them corrupts calibration).
- `intex_pool.set_schedule` gained a **config entry selector** for multi-entry installs, and the
  service is registered at component setup (a call without a loaded entry now gives a clear
  validation error).
- Card: pH/ORP tiles are colored by the device's own **indicator** verdicts when available;
  free-chlorine tile; source maps for debugging; deterministic cross-platform card build
  (`build.mjs`).
- Quality-scale polish: `SensorDeviceClass.PH` on the pH sensor, `DURATION` on runtime sensors,
  `suggested_display_precision` everywhere, all icons moved to `icons.json` (state-dependent alarm
  icon), exception translations, `data_description` help texts in setup, and stale device-registry
  entries can now be deleted from the UI after a reconfigure.

### Changed
- The `set_schedule` service caps `duration` at 72 h (matching the duration entities and the
  longest boost cycle in the manual).
- Tuya error messages no longer quote raw response bodies (only code/msg fields).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Reporting cadence** select on the water sensor (`report_number`) — choose whether the analyzer
  reports ORP / pH / free-chlorine by week or by month.
- **Temperature unit** select on the water sensor (°C / °F). Note: the sensor-side polarity reuses
  the verified saltwater-system polarity and should be live-verified — it may be inverted.
- **Re-test now** button on the saltwater system (`retest_switch`, DP 107) — forces a fresh
  salt/temperature measurement, mirroring the sensor's existing Refresh button.

### Fixed
- Cloud-side selects (water sensor) now write via the cloud property path instead of the local-only
  path, so the new sensor selects actually apply. (Internal: the select/button write path is now
  device-aware — local devices write over the LAN, cloud devices issue a property.)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- Setup no longer shows a dead/empty device picker when cloud discovery returns no devices — it
  now shows a clear "no devices found — set up manually instead" message so you're never stuck on
  a blank dropdown. The reconfigure flow now does the same (re-prompts for credentials instead of
  showing an empty picker).

### Changed
- The discovery device dropdowns accept a typed/pasted device id (`custom_value`), so a finicky or
  incomplete list can't block setup.
- `hacs.json` now sets `render_readme` so the full README (with screenshots + install button) shows
  on the HACS page.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Reconfigure flow.** Integration entry → **⋮ → Reconfigure** re-runs cloud discovery (reusing
  your stored credentials) so you can repoint to a **replaced device** that got a new Tuya id —
  without removing the integration. The current devices are pre-selected; unchanged devices keep
  their stored IP/key (no rescan needed), so a swap keeps all your entity ids and history.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Reauthentication flow.** When the Tuya `local_key` rotates (e.g. after re-pairing the
  device in the app) or a cloud secret is rejected, the integration now raises
  `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` and Home Assistant prompts you to enter the new key/secret instead of
  the device going silently unavailable forever.
- Config/CI hygiene: `ruff` lint job, Dependabot (actions + npm), issue templates, PR template,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`.

### Changed
- Setup now reports `ConfigEntryNotReady` when **every** configured device fails its first poll,
  so Home Assistant retries with backoff instead of loading with all entities unavailable.
- The bundled card is served with a `?v={version}` cache-buster, so a HACS update loads the new
  card without a manual browser hard-refresh.
- The card version is now injected from `package.json` at build time (no more hard-coded drift).
- Setup errors now distinguish **invalid credentials** from **cannot connect**.

### Fixed
- `schedule.py` no longer raises on a corrupt/truncated cloud schedule blob (decodes to empty).
- `validate_local` re-raises the real connection error (preserving its type/traceback) after
  exhausting retries, so the config flow can tell auth from transport failures.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Turning **Boost** on now suspends your timed schedules (they're remembered and restored when
  Boost is turned off), mirroring how the unit reverts to its normal schedule after a boost. A
  second Boost turn-on can't wipe the remembered schedules, and the suspended set survives a
  Home Assistant restart.

### Changed
- `schedule.py` documents the now-verified `skdl_salt` field semantics from the device's Tuya
  thing-model (`worktime` = duration, `week` bitmask with bit7 = weekly repeat, `control` = on;
  `control = 0` + long duration is the Boost cycle, reported back as `working_indicator = boost`).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Schedule slot 0 is now presented as **Boost**: a toggle + **Boost duration** (hours) only, with
  no start-time entity (boost runs for a duration, not at a clock time).

### Fixed
- Upgrade migration (config-entry v1 → v2) removes the orphaned `time.…_schedule_1_start` entity
  left by earlier versions so it no longer lingers as "unavailable".

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- Temperature-unit select was inverted: on the real hardware DP124 is True for °C / False for °F
  (opposite of the thing-model doc). Now matches the device.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- The **Pump switch** selector now shows in the device's main controls (not the Configuration
  section), so it's easy to find on the Sand filter pump device.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Cleaner schedule device page: empty slots' Start time / Duration editors are now hidden
  (unavailable) so only active schedules show; toggling an empty slot on creates an editable
  daily default you can adjust.
- The linked pump's controls (Auto mode + a new **Pump switch** selector) are grouped under
  their own **Sand filter pump** device — and you can change the pump switch right there.

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate/orphaned per-slot schedule sensors left over from an earlier version.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Edit schedules under the device:** each slot now has an editable **Start time** and
  **Duration** entity (in Configuration), alongside the on/off toggle — full per-schedule
  editing without the action.
- **Change the linked pump after setup:** the integration's **Configure** (options) now lets
  you pick the pump switch (and optional power/energy sensors) for an entity-linked pump.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Pump auto mode** switch: when on, a linked (any-brand) pump runs only while the saltwater
  system is on.
- **Per-slot schedule switches** (`Schedule 1`…`Schedule 7`): turn each schedule on/off; turning
  one off remembers it so it can be turned back on.

### Fixed
- Editing a schedule now reflects in HA right away (the Tuya cloud needs a few seconds to apply
  a write; the read-back was happening too soon).
- `E93` is shown as **Standby**, not an alarm, on the card and in the alarm sensor.
- The dashboard card is now fully English.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Schedules are now **visible without digging into attributes**: one sensor per schedule slot
  (`Schedule 1`…`Schedule 7`) under the saltwater device, each showing its summary, plus a
  **schedules list on the dashboard card**.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Saltwater schedules** are now visible in HA: a read-only `Schedules` sensor (state = number
  of active schedules; attributes list each one — daily/one-time, time, duration, on/boost).
  The schedule blob (`skdl_salt`) is cloud-only and was previously unexposed; it's now decoded.
- **`intex_pool.set_schedule` service** to create / change / clear a schedule slot from HA
  (writes back via the Tuya cloud). The codec round-trips byte-exact and the cloud write path
  is verified; field meanings (duration unit, days mask, boost) are best-effort.

### Notes
- Schedules require a configured water sensor (its Tuya cloud credentials) + a saltwater system.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Selectable card appearance** via a `variant` option: `auto` (follows your HA theme),
  `light`, `dark`, and two designed dark looks — **ocean** (teal gradient) and **midnight**
  (deep indigo). Choose it in the card editor.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Cloud auto-discovery setup (much easier):** enter your Tuya IoT cloud credentials once and
  the integration lists your devices (with their local keys) and LAN-scans for IPs — just pick
  which devices are the pool gear. No manual local-key extraction, no IP typing.
- Manual entry is kept as a fallback (tick "set up manually").

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Redesigned the dashboard card to be compact: a tight header with status, a single row of
  core metric tiles (pH / ORP / temp / salt) with at-a-glance in-range bars, and compact
  control pills (power / chlorine / pump) — instead of three tall stacked sections.
- Dropped the "free chlorine" tile from the card by default (device value is calculated /
  reference-only and misleads when the ORP probe is faulty).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial release: config-flow setup for any combination of water sensor (cloud),
  saltwater system (local), and sand-filter pump (local Tuya **or** linked HA switch — any brand).
- Native entities: sensors, binary sensors, switches, numbers, button, selects, with
  decoded status/alarm/error and per-device connectivity.
- Self-loading adaptive Lovelace card `custom:intex-pool-card`.
- English + Danish translations.
- HACS + hassfest CI validation; pytest suite.
