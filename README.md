## ✨ Why this exists

Home Assistant's official Tuya integration maps these `rs`-category pool devices to empty
`climate` shells; LocalTuya / tuya-local have no working profile; and the water sensor is
cloud-only. **Intex Pool** talks to each device the way that actually works and gives you
clean, named entities — plus a card that looks good out of the box.

## 🧩 Supported equipment

Pick **any combination** — one, two, or all three:

| | Device | Connection | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| 💧 | **Water quality sensor** (AGP Smart Sensor / Water Analyzer) | Tuya cloud | pH, ORP, free chlorine, temp, battery · writable pH/ORP targets · refresh button |
| 🧂 | **Saltwater system** (Intex/AGP QS-series) | Local LAN | Power & chlorine switches, salinity, water temp, self-clean & temp-unit selects, decoded status/alarm/error |
| 🌀 | **Sand-filter pump** | Local Tuya **or any HA switch** | On/off + Tuya timer schedules, or linked power / energy |

> 🔌 **Any brand of pump works.** Not a Tuya device? Link any existing HA switch (Shelly,
> Zigbee relay, …) and it joins the pool card alongside the Intex gear.

> 🔄 **Pump auto mode.** With a linked pump, a **Pump auto mode** switch makes the pump follow
> the saltwater system: it runs while chlorination is on and stops when it's off — no
> automation needed.

<details>
<summary>📋 Full entity reference</summary>

**Water sensor (cloud):** pH, ORP, free chlorine (reference only), water temperature, battery,
**Last measurement** timestamp, pH/ORP/chlorine indicators, **ORP trend**, maintenance,
error code, link status, connectivity, **Measurement schedules** · pH target & ORP target
numbers · reporting-cadence & temperature-unit selects · stabilizer (CYA) flag switch ·
**Refresh measurement** button · **Error** event · pH/ORP calibration-coefficient diagnostics
(disabled by default).

**Saltwater system (local):** power & chlorine-production switches (a second, unverified
"Chlorine production 2" switch ships disabled), salinity, water temperature, cell runtime,
**cell wear**, time remaining, status, **Alarm** (sensor + event), error code, **Cold water**
guard, **Action required** roll-up (with `reasons`), mesh/pump-mesh status, connectivity ·
self-clean & temperature-unit selects · **Re-test now** button · **Schedules** sensor +
per-slot toggle/duration/start-time entities (slot 0 = **Boost**) · **Salt to add** advisor
(enable by setting your pool volume under ⋮ → Configure).

**Pump:** on/off switch (Tuya mode) or your own linked switch + **Pump auto mode** and a
**Pump switch** selector (entity mode), connectivity and **Schedules** sensor + per-slot
editors (Tuya mode).
</details>

> 🧂 **Salt dose advisor.** Set your pool volume (the **Pool volume** entity on the device
> page, or **⋮ → Configure**; litres or US gallons via the **Volume unit** select) and the
> **Salt to add** sensor tells you how many kg reach the target salinity (default 950 ppm,
> the QS-series optimum) — or, above 1800 ppm, how much water to drain per the manual.
> Advisory only; it never actuates anything.

> ⚖️ **LSI water balance.** Enter your latest test-strip/drop-kit results in the
> **Total alkalinity / Calcium hardness / Cyanuric acid (test)** entities and the **LSI**
> sensor computes the Langelier Saturation Index live from the (calibrated) pH and water
> temperature — with a **Water balance** sensor interpreting it (balanced −0.3…+0.3 per
> CDC MAHC; corrosive below, scaling above). For saltwater pools the TDS term
> automatically uses the live salinity. Math follows the published industry tables
> (Taylor watergram / CDC MAHC / Wojtowicz).

> 🧪 **Calibrate against your own test.** Took a strip or drop test? Call
> **`intex_pool.calibrate`** with what it showed (e.g. `parameter: ph`,
> `reference_value: 7.4`) and the pH reading is aligned via a software offset — the raw
> value stays in the `raw_value` attribute. Guardrails reject offsets beyond ±0.5 pH
> (that's clean-and-recalibrate territory), and the offsets auto-reset when you run the
> real buffer calibration in the Intex app. A drop test kit is the recommended reference —
> strips are coarse (±0.3–0.5 pH). The app's buffer-powder calibration every 4 months
> remains the authoritative baseline; this is the drift bridge in between.

## 📸 The card adapts to what you have

It shows only the sections for the equipment you own — chemistry-only, full, or pump-only.
Saltwater and pump schedules are detected and labelled independently:

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/card-variants.png" width="820" alt="The card adapts: sensor only, all three, pump only" />
</div>

The card is served **by the integration itself** — no separate HACS plugin to install. After
installing or updating through HACS, **restart Home Assistant and fully reload the browser tab
or companion app** so its frontend module is loaded. Then add **“Intex Pool”** from the card
picker; it auto-detects your entities.

If it still does not appear in the picker, first verify that
`/intex_pool/intex-pool-card.js` opens on your Home Assistant host. As a fallback, add that URL
as a **JavaScript module** under **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**, reload the frontend,
and use the YAML card type shown below.

## 🎨 Choose your look

A **`variant`** option lets you pick the style right in the card editor — `auto` (follows your
Home Assistant theme), `light`, `dark`, and two designed dark looks: **ocean** (teal gradient)
and **midnight** (deep indigo):

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/card-styles.png" width="860" alt="Dark style variants: dark, ocean, midnight" />
</div>

```yaml
type: custom:intex-pool-card
variant: ocean   # auto | light | dark | ocean | midnight
```

## 🗓️ Schedules

The saltwater system's built-in schedules live only in the cloud as an encoded blob, so they're
normally invisible. This integration **decodes them**: a read-only **Schedules** sensor shows
how many are active and lists each (daily/one-time, time, duration, on/boost). Each slot also gets
its own **toggle**, **duration** and **start-time** entities under the device, so you can turn a
schedule on/off and retune it without the service call.

> **Slot 0 = Boost.** The first slot is the device's **Boost** cycle. It runs for a set number of
> hours rather than at a clock time (the app ignores a start time for it), so it's exposed as
> **Boost** + **Boost duration** only — no start-time entity. Turning **Boost on suspends your
> timed schedules** (they're remembered, then restored when Boost is turned off) — mirroring how
> the unit reverts to its normal schedule after a boost completes, and confirmed against the
> device's Tuya thing-model (`working_indicator` reports `boost`).

You can also **edit** any slot from HA with the **`intex_pool.set_schedule`** service (writes back via the cloud):

```yaml
service: intex_pool.set_schedule
data:
  slot: 4          # 0–6
  enable: true     # off behaves like the boost cycle
  hour: 22
  minute: 0
  duration: 2
  days: 255        # 255 = every day, 0 = one-time (then set month/date)
```

> Schedules are cloud-only. Cloud discovery keeps the credentials for a pump-only or
> saltwater-only setup; manual local setup still controls the device but has no schedules.
> Use **Reconfigure** and enter Tuya cloud credentials to enable them. If Tuya is offline
> while Home Assistant starts, local controls stay available and the schedule entities
> recover automatically on a later poll. The byte format round-trips exactly; the exact
> units of duration/days are best-effort.

## 🚀 Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Hovborg&repository=intex-pool&category=integration)

1. Click the button above (or HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → `https://github.com/Hovborg/intex-pool`, category **Integration**).
2. Download **Intex Pool** in HACS and **restart Home Assistant**.
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Intex Pool**.
4. Enter your Tuya cloud credentials and pick your devices (see below).

## ⚙️ Setup — the easy way (cloud auto-discovery)

You only need **Tuya IoT developer-cloud credentials** once: a free project at
[iot.tuya.com](https://iot.tuya.com) (region, Access ID, Access secret) with your Smart
Life / Tuya app account linked. Enter those and the integration will:

- 🔑 **fetch your devices and their local keys automatically** (no `tinytuya wizard`), and
- 📡 **scan your network for their IPs + protocol version automatically** (no IP typing).

Then pick the discovered **saltwater system**, **water sensor** and/or **Tuya pump** you own.
Alternatively, link any existing Home Assistant switch as your sand-filter pump.

### Link the Tuya account and choose the exact region

Tuya's supported developer-cloud flow is:

1. Create a **Smart Home** cloud project at `iot.tuya.com` and keep **IoT Core** active.
2. Open the project, go to **Devices → Link App Account**, and add an app account.
3. Scan the authorization QR code with **Tuya Smart** or **Smart Life**. Wait for the
   authorization to propagate, then confirm that the pool device appears under **All Devices**.
4. In Intex Pool, select the data center used by that exact project:
   `eu` (Central Europe), `eu-w` (Western Europe), `us` (Western America),
   `us-e` (Eastern America), `cn`, `in`, or `sg`.

Tuya's documented account-linking flow uses Tuya Smart or Smart Life. A device that exists
only in the Intex Link app may therefore not appear in a Tuya developer project. Before moving
or re-pairing equipment, check what vendor-app automations or device relationships you rely on.
Re-pairing rotates the device's local key, so any existing local Home Assistant setup must be
re-authenticated afterward.

> 🔁 The water sensor sleeps and reports about once an hour — tap **Refresh measurement** to
> force a fresh reading.

<details>
<summary>🔧 Manual setup (fallback, no cloud)</summary>

Tick **“set up manually”** in the first step and enter each device's **device id**, **local
key** and **IP** by hand (get them with [tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya)).
Protocol version can be left on **auto**. Note: local devices still need their local key,
which for these `rs` devices ultimately comes from the Tuya cloud — so the cloud path is
usually simplest.

The manual IP field is the device's current private **LAN IP**, not an address shown for a
cloud service. Reserve that address in DHCP when possible. **Auto** tries protocol versions
3.4, 3.5, 3.3, and 3.1 once each, then stores the version that answered successfully. This
keeps later Home Assistant startups on the proven version.
</details>

## 🔧 Keeping it running

Pools get re-paired and gear gets replaced — both are handled from the UI, with no need to
delete and re-add the integration:

- 🔑 **Local key changed?** Re-pairing a device in the Tuya / Smart Life app rotates its
  **local key**, which breaks the local connection (saltwater system or a Tuya pump). Home
  Assistant then starts **re-authentication** automatically — just type the new local key
  (and, for the cloud sensor, the access secret). Each local device has its own key field,
  so any combination works.
- 🔁 **Replaced a device?** When you swap a physical unit, the new one gets a new Tuya id.
  Open **Settings → Devices & Services → Intex Pool → ⋮ → Reconfigure** to re-run discovery
  and pick the new device. The existing entry is updated **in place** — your entity ids and
  history are kept, and unchanged devices keep their stored IP/key (no re-scan needed). The
  old device can then be deleted from its device page.
- ⏱️ **Polling intervals** are tunable under **⋮ → Configure** (local default 15 s, cloud
  default 120 s — well inside the Tuya free-tier API quota).

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

- 🚨 **Repairs**: actionable problems show up in **Settings → Repairs** — saltwater alarms
  (low flow E90, salt out of range E91/E92, electrode/temperature faults, …) with the
  manual's fix steps, a **maintenance** reminder when the sensor probes need cleaning or
  calibration, and a **stale data** warning when the sensor (which reports ~1×/hour) hasn't
  measured for hours.
- 📄 **Diagnostics**: the integration page's **Download diagnostics** includes the raw device
  data for bug reports — local keys and cloud credentials are redacted automatically.
- ⏰ **Alarm/error events**: `event.…_alarm` and `event.…_error` fire on every transition, so
  you can build notifications without templating against the enum sensors.
- ☁️ **Tuya cloud trial expired?** The free IoT Core trial eventually lapses; renew it for
  free at [iot.tuya.com](https://iot.tuya.com) → Cloud → your project → **View Details** →
  extend trial. The integration surfaces auth failures as a re-authentication prompt.
- 🌍 **Cloud project returns no devices?** Confirm that IoT Core is active, the app account is
  linked to the project, the device is visible under All Devices, authorization has had time
  to propagate, and Intex Pool uses the exact project data center. Central and Western Europe
  use different endpoints (`eu` and `eu-w`).
- 📉 **No measurement-history backfill**: Tuya's device-log APIs do not return data-point
  report history on the free IoT Core tier (verified live — only online/offline events come
  back), so readings taken while Home Assistant was down cannot be recovered. History
  accumulates normally in HA's own recorder while it runs.

<details>
<summary>🗑️ Removing the integration</summary>

**Settings → Devices & Services → Intex Pool → ⋮ → Delete.** This removes the entry, its
devices and entities. To finish the cleanup, remove the HACS download (HACS → Intex Pool →
remove) and restart Home Assistant. Nothing is left on the devices themselves — they keep
working in the Intex Link / Smart Life app.
</details>

## 🧪 Compatibility

Built and **live-verified** against the **AGP / Intex QS-series saltwater chlorinator**
(QS1600 Plus) and the **AGP Smart Sensor / Water Analyzer (WA510 and T3U)**. Other Intex/Tuya pool models connect the
same way, but their data-point numbering may differ — some entities could be missing or
wrong. Have a different model? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Hovborg/intex-pool/issues)
with your device's data points and it can be added. The sand-filter pump works with **any**
brand via the “existing switch” link. See the evidence levels and known caveats in the
[compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md).
