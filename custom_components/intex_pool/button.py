    one-off run (``on=1`` + a specific date) — NOT the saltwater

    specifically to chlorinator hardware (see ``IntexScheduleSlotSwitch``'s
    ``_is_boost`` docstring) and does not apply to the pump.

    A plain manual on/off (the ``pump``/``pump_filter`` switches) has no
    duration parameter at all and always falls back to the device's own
    fixed default run time — this button is the only way from Home Assistant
